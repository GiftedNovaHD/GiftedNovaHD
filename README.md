### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# `$ whoami`
I started programming at the age of 12, where I familiarized myself with the C-family of programming languages, namely C and C++. My passion in programming brought me to the area of information security, where I found fun in breaking things (that aren't supposed to break). Over the years, my interest in information security extended beyond my interest in low-level manifestations, into other areas such as cloud security. After all, it probably isn't a bad idea to be well-rounded in your field of interest!


# Stuff that I am learning ðŸŒ±
Recently, I have been exploring artificial intelligence (AI) in my free time. I find the relationship between rigorous mathematical models and its applications in scientific computing extremely elegant and intriguing, which was one of the motivations in learning more about AI. I am currently playing around with Jax as my main library for machine learning applications.

# Other things 
- I am in college 
- I like to lift weights in my free time
